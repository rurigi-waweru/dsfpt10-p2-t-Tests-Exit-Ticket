# Question 1
Suppose a skewed sample of snout lengths leads me to conclude that I've discovered a new species of alligator when in fact the alligators I've observed are not different in kind from previously accepted species. What sort of mistake have I made?

> (i) A Type II error. 

> (ii) A false positive. 

> (iii) A true negative. 

> (iv) A measurement error. 

> (v) No error, since I applied the hypothesis test correctly.
## `Explanation`
The mistake described is concluding that you've discovered a new species when, in reality, the alligators belong to an already known species. This means you've incorrectly rejected the null hypothesis (which would state that there is no new species).

## This corresponds to:

A Type I error, which is also known as a false positive (option ii).

A Type I error occurs when we mistakenly reject a true null hypothesis—meaning we conclude there is an effect (a new species) when there actually isn't one.

`Answer:`

(ii) A false positive.
`SUMMARY`

In hypothesis testing, we start with a null hypothesis (H₀), which in this case would state that the alligators you observed belong to a previously known species. The alternative hypothesis (H₁) would be that you've discovered a new species.

By analyzing snout lengths, you conclude that the alligators are a new species, when in fact they are not. This means you have incorrectly rejected the null hypothesis, even though it was actually true.

This kind of mistake is known as a Type I error, also called a false positive. A false positive occurs when we detect an effect (a new species) that does not actually exist.

`Why is it not the other options?`
>(i) A Type II error – This happens when we fail to reject a false null hypothesis (i.e., we do not detect a new species even though one actually exists). This is not the case here.

> (iii) A true negative – This means correctly failing to reject the null hypothesis, which would mean recognizing that the alligators belong to an existing species. That is the opposite of what happened.

> (iv) A measurement error – A skewed sample might contribute to a wrong conclusion, but a measurement error specifically refers to errors in data collection (e.g., using a faulty ruler). Your mistake is due to statistical inference, not measurement error.

> (v) No error, since I applied the hypothesis test correctly – Even if the test was applied correctly, an incorrect conclusion still represents an error.

`Final Answer:`

(ii) A false positive (Type I error).
# Question 2
Suppose I want to compare a sample of twenty gizmos made at Factory B to a known population of gizmos made at Factory A. I know the mean and standard deviation of the Factory A gizmos. What sort of hypothesis test should I conduct?

> [i] A z-test since I know the population parameters.

> [ii] A t-test since I can calculate the sample statistics.

> [iii] A t-test since I have a sample size less than 30.

> [iv] A z-test since I can expect a normally distributed variable here.

> [v] A t-test, provided there is no significant difference between the sample and the population means.
### Analyzing the Question
You want to compare a sample of 20 gizmos from Factory B to a known population of gizmos from Factory A, and you already know the mean and standard deviation of the Factory A population.

### Choosing the Correct Test
When to use a z-test?

A z-test is used when comparing a sample mean to a population mean and the population standard deviation is known.
It assumes that the sample follows a normal distribution (which is reasonable for large samples due to the Central Limit Theorem).
When to use a t-test?

A t-test is used when the sample size is small (n < 30) and the population standard deviation is unknown, requiring the use of the sample standard deviation instead.

`Applying This to the Question`

You are comparing a sample (n = 20) to a known population.
You know the population mean and standard deviation.
Since the population standard deviation is known, a z-test is appropriate regardless of the sample size.

`Correct Answer:`

✅ "A z-test since I know the population parameters."
